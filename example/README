Example use of ldpc over GF(255):
In this folder i am storing some files i have been using in an experiment with the LDPC codec. 
The experment has been performed using a prototype GMSK codec with 12.5 kHz of bandwidth over 869mhz SRD band using 2 limesdrs arond .5 m apart with very low power. I assume this will will be quite similar to an AWGN channel and mainly limited by thermal noise. 

I have encoded a test sample with codec2 700C mode and repeated the file to fit my codec. 

data_soft_00000_00097.float contains soft output data from my modem with an SNR that is not correctable by LDPC, but still that is corrected sufficiently so the data is understandable.

phaseplot.png shows the data plotted as in a QPSK constellation with gnuradio. 

I have included the following files for your testing:

python ~/pgmz/corrtest/ldpc/float2llr.py data_soft_00000_00097.float data_soft_00000_00097.llr

../gfhf8 ../GF256K720Dc4.alist ../GF256K720Dc4.mtx dec data_soft_00000_00097.llr data_soft_00000_00097_decoded.bin

cp data_soft_00000_00097_decoded.bin data_soft_00000_00097_decoded.c2

(the first 8 bytes of the codec2 file (i.e the header) should be copied from the source file, so the codec2 software knows what format it is decoding).
